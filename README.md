# About K+ 
K+ is a small team with the goal of making users web experience safe. Currently we are working on "PG" our Password generator! Before that we worked on small android tool apps! We also created our own android app store because we did not like to policies from Google.

K+ started 2019 with small android apps like "calendar, notes,..." (All in German.). Then we created an own app Store with all our apps downloadable as .apk files. Unfortunately we lost all files and could not continue developing. And that gave us an idea... We saw many people having problems using it. It had simplified UI but the download mechanism was too hard for people with too less knowledge about technology. They didn't know how dangerous it is too have a bad Password. So here's the idea: A simple password generator! It just generates passwords. And that's it! This simple mechanics can help people's online accounts not to get hacked. A tool that has no ads and no trackers and is open source. Working local and also has the ability to save passwords local. A lot safer then saving passwords in the browser.
